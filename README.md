A very fast flight mod for PC gorilla tag.


Instructions
-Download, make a folder in the plugins folder and drag and drop the DLL file into it, make sure you are using BepInEx.
Hold the B button down to fly
Hit the A button to stop all velocity
Hold both of the two grip buttons and the B button to enter super sonic mode

also these controls are for the oculus quest so if you have a different headset good luck, but it still will work.

Does not work in public lobby's and make sure to download it though the releases
